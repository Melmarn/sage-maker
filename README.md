# sage-maker
This is the 5th project from [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program]((https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101))

### Project Overview
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

The deployment project is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed to have a working notebook instance in which one can clone the deployment repository.
